## Overview

This application uses the Express framework to create a simple web server that listens for HTTP requests. The main functionality of the app is to provide a health check endpoint that returns the status of the server.

## Installation

To get started with this application, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the application:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install Express:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

3. **Set up the environment:**

   You can set the environment variable `PORT` to define which port the server should listen on. If not set, the server will default to port `3000`.

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the server by running:

```bash
node app.js
```
*Replace `app.js` with the name of your main file if it differs.*

Once the server is running, you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000/status` in your web browser or using a tool like Postman or curl.

## Endpoints

### `GET /status`

- **Description**: Returns the current status of the server.
- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "running"
  }
  ```

- **Status Codes**:
  - 200 OK: If the server is running and the request is successful.
  - 500 Internal Server Error: If an unexpected error occurs on the server.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling. If any unforeseen error occurs while processing a request, the server will log the error to the console and respond with a `500 Internal Server Error` status, along with an error message in JSON format:

```json
{
  "error": "internal server error"
}
```

## Code

Below is the code for the Express server:

```javascript
// Import Express
const express = require('express');

// Set up Express to create an app and configure it to parse requests with JSON payloads
const app = express ();

app.use(express.json());

// Define a route that listens to requests
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/status", (request, response) => {  
    try {  
      const status = {  
        "status": "running"  
      };  
      
      response.status(200).send(status);  
    } catch (error) {  
      console.error(error);  
      response.status(500).send({ "error": "internal server error" });  
    }  
});

// Set up the server to listen on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log("Server Listening on PORT:", PORT);
});
```
